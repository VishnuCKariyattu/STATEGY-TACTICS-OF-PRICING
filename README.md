Comprehensive Analysis on the target pricing for Harley Davidson Livewire Electric model 

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of Harley-Davidson’s (HD) pricing strategy for its electric motorcycle segment, primarily focusing on its LiveWire subsidiary. The paper explores Harley-Davidson’s historical legacy as a leader in the motorcycle industry and examines how the company is positioning itself in the growing electric vehicle (EV) market.

The analysis begins by outlining Harley-Davidson’s traditional business model, customer segments, and its move towards electric motorcycles through the acquisition of LiveWire. The LiveWire brand, catering to a younger, urban audience, contrasts Harley’s traditional customer base, which typically prefers larger, internal combustion engine motorcycles. The paper emphasizes the technological advancements and value-added features of LiveWire motorcycles, highlighting how they cater to the practical needs of younger riders.

A key focus of the paper is on pricing strategies used by LiveWire, such as value-based pricing, third-degree price discrimination, and psychological pricing techniques like anchoring. The paper examines LiveWire’s competitive landscape, comparing it with other EV motorcycle manufacturers such as Zero and Energica. It discusses the challenges HD faces in commanding a premium price in the EV segment, pointing to the price sensitivity of younger customers and competition from established and emerging players.

The paper also includes a contribution analysis of LiveWire’s cost structure, highlighting cost advantages from strategic partnerships and scale economies. Additionally, it suggests that Harley-Davidson should focus on continuous innovation, product differentiation, and adapting its pricing strategy to gain market share in the growing EV motorcycle segment. Ultimately, the paper argues that Harley-Davidson’s success in the EV market will depend on its ability to create a new legacy in electric motorcycles while preserving its iconic brand.
